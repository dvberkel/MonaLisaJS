MonaLisaJS
==========

MonaLisaJS is a project in preperation for [JSConf EU][1].

It aims to "solve" the [travelling salesman problem][2] in JavaScript
in a visual stunning way by rendering a interpretation of the 
[Mona Lisa][3].

Setup
-----

This project uses [submodules][5]. Run the following commands to get a
working project.

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

Travelling Salesman Problem
---------------------------

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a famous problem in the
theory of [graphs][6].

> Given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, the task is to
> find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once
> and returns to the origin city.

TSP was first formulated by the mathematicians [Hamilton][7] and
[Kirkman][8]. It is know to belong the [NP-complete][9].
complexity class.

Mona Lisa
---------

The Mona Lisa (La Gioconda) is a famous painting by the famous Italian
Renaissance artist [Leonardo da Vinci][10]. The painting is well known for the 
[enigmatic smile][11].
