MonaLisaJS
==========

MonaLisaJS is a project in preperation for
[JSConf EU](http://2012.jsconf.eu/ "Homepage for JSConf EU").

It aims to "solve" the 
[travelling salesman problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem "Wikipedia on Travelling salesman problem.")
in JavaScript in a visual stunning way by rendering a interpretation

Travelling Salesman Problem
---------------------------

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a famous problem in the
theory of
[graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory "Wikipedia on Graph Theory").

> Given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, the task is to
> find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once
> and returns to the origin city.

TSP was first formulated by the mathematicians 
[Hamilton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Rowan_Hamilton "Wikipedia on Hamilton")
and
[Kirkman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Kirkman "Wikipedia on Kirkman").
It is know to belong the
[NP-complete]("Wikipedia on Computational Complexity Theory")
complexity class.
